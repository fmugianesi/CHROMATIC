# CHROMATIC  
CHROMATIC is a computational tool that integrates Hi-C and ChIP-seq data to study chromatin three-dimensional (3D) interactions associated with any factor of interest.   
It is faster and less expensive than performing experiments that probe protein-directed genome architecture, such as HiChIP. 
Thanks to the deconvolution of the Hi-C data into factor-specific interactions, our strategy allows discerning the role of each studied factor in genome 3D structure in a cell-type-specific manner.  
Furthermore, the classification of 3D colocalization patterns of factors using CHROMATIC identifies types of functional 3D interactions, that we call ‘3D-types’. 3D-types may reflect already known interactions between different chromatin factors or may help discover new associations between molecules with specific functional roles.  
Overall, the CHROMATIC tool unifies factor occupancy and genome topology analyses, to shed light on their link with gene expression.
